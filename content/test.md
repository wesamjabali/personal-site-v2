# Main Title

This is some placeholder stuff. Don't expect a full blog post here, I just want to see what it looks like when I have a paragraph or two written -- Even if it has nothing to do with anything. This might be what a real post looks like! To begin. You can read the [Content API docs](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/content-directory) for more information.

Here's some code: 
```js
this.is some code.
console.log('nothing.')
// This is a comment
```
